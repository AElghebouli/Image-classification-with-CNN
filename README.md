# Image-classification-with-CNN
This work consists in creating a CNN model for the classification of two types of images, images from the movie "Toy Story", and other images from the movie "Ernest &amp; Celestine". This CNN model will be trained on 500 images (size 920x540) for both types of images.
This model can be summarized as follows: n/
## Input → Convolution → ReLU → MaxPooling → Convolution → ReLU → MaxPooling → FC → ReLU → FC → Sigmoid → Output
